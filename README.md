👋 Hi, I’m Pritee — DevOps Engineer | Cloud & Kubernetes 

💻 3+ years in IT, looking for opportunities in DevOps/SRE/Platform Engineering
🔁 I design, break, fix, and automate systems end-to-end

🔧 Toolkit
- AWS (EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, EKS), Docker, Kubernetes
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Jenkins
- IaC: Terraform
- Observability: Prometheus, Grafana
- Linux, Bash | Oracle PL/SQL (DBA background)

📌 What I’m doing now
- Building production-style DevOps projects
- Prepping for Kubernetes certifications
- Optimizing infra cost/reliability and incident response

🚀 Featured work
- Kubernetes Blog CMS: 3-tier app on EKS with Jenkins CI/CD, Prometheus/Grafana monitoring, Slack alerts

🧠 Mindset
“Skills over titles. Proof over claims. Consistency over motivation.” I learn by doing, not just collecting badges.
